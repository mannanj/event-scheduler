# Event Scheduler

All your events, everywhere, in one beautiful place.

## What We're Building

A tool that takes events from any platform—Meetup, Facebook, random websites—and brings them together in one unified view.

**The Problem:** Your events are scattered across different platforms. Checking what's happening means opening multiple tabs, apps, and websites.

**The Solution:** Paste a URL, get a clean event. All events stored locally in standardized JSON. Beautiful Next.js interface to see everything.

## How It Works

1. You give us an event URL (Meetup, Facebook, website, etc.)
2. We parse it and convert to a standard format
3. Save it locally as JSON
4. View all your events in one place

## The Standard Format

Every event becomes:
- Title, description, dates
- Location (physical or virtual)
- Organizer info
- Price/free status
- Tags and categories
- Source platform

Clean, portable JSON files you own.

## Platforms We'll Support

- Meetup
- Facebook Events
- Custom websites
- More as needed

## What You'll See

A Next.js web app showing:
- All your events in a calendar/list view
- Filter by date, location, category
- Search across all events
- One place to see what's happening
